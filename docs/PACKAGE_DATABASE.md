## How to Contribute

### Adding New Packages

#### Method 1: GitHub Issue (Easiest)

1. Go to [Issues](https://github.com/gensecaihq/Shai-Hulud-2.0-Detector/issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Package Report" template
4. Fill in the details:

```markdown
## Package Report

**Package Name:** @scope/package-name
**npm Link:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scope/package-name
**Severity:** critical

### Evidence

- [ ] Contains setup_bun.js
- [ ] Contains bun_environment.js
- [ ] Suspicious postinstall script
- [ ] Published during attack window (Nov 24, 2025)
- [ ] Other (describe below)

### Evidence Details

[Paste links, screenshots, or analysis here]

### Source

Where did you find this information?
- [ ] Personal discovery
- [ ] Security advisory
- [ ] Researcher report
- [ ] Other: ___________
```

#### Method 2: Pull Request (Preferred for Multiple Packages)

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Shai-Hulud-2.0-Detector.git
   cd Shai-Hulud-2.0-Detector
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-packages/your-name
   ```

3. **Edit compromised-packages.json**

   Add new packages to the `packages` array (maintain alphabetical order):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "@new-scope/new-package",
     "severity": "critical",
     "affectedVersions": ["*"]
   }
   ```

4. **Update statistics**
   ```bash
   # Run the stats updater (if available)
   node scripts/update-stats.js

   # Or manually update stats.totalUniquePackages
   ```

5. **Build and test**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Commit with evidence**
   ```bash
   git add compromised-packages.json
   git commit -m "feat(db): add @new-scope/new-package

   Evidence: [link to analysis]
   Source: [researcher name/advisory]"
   ```

7. **Submit PR**
   - Push to your fork
   - Create PR with detailed description
   - Link to evidence

#### Method 3: Batch Submission (For Researchers)

If you've identified many packages:

1. Create a CSV file:
   ```csv
   name,severity,evidence_url
   @scope/pkg1,critical,https://...
   @scope/pkg2,critical,https://...
   pkg3,high,https://...
   ```

2. Open an issue with the CSV attached
3. Or use our submission script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/batch-submit.js packages.csv
   ```

### Reporting False Positives

If a package is incorrectly flagged:

1. **Open an Issue**
   - Title: `[False Positive] package-name`
   - Provide evidence the package is clean

2. **Required Evidence:**
   - Official statement from maintainers
   - Code audit showing no malicious code
   - Timestamp proving publish before attack
   - npm security team confirmation

3. **PR to Remove:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/false-positive-package-name
   # Remove from compromised-packages.json
   git commit -m "fix(db): remove false positive package-name

   Evidence: [link]"
   ```

### Updating Package Information

To update severity or affected versions:

```bash
# Edit compromised-packages.json
# Change:
{
  "name": "@scope/package",
  "severity": "critical",
  "affectedVersions": ["*"]
}

# To:
{
  "name": "@scope/package",
  "severity": "critical",
  "affectedVersions": [">=1.0.0 <1.0.5"],
  "patchedVersion": "1.0.5",
  "advisory": "https://..."
}
```

## Evidence Requirements

### Minimum Evidence (Required)

At least ONE of the following:

| Evidence Type | Description | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Malicious File | Package contains known malicious files | `setup_bun.js` found in package |
| File Hash Match | Files match known malicious hashes | SHA-1 matches IOC list |
| Postinstall Script | Suspicious lifecycle script | Downloads external payload |
| Maintainer Compromise | Maintainer account was compromised | Same maintainer as known bad pkg |
| Security Advisory | Official security advisory | npm advisory, GitHub advisory |

### Strong Evidence (Preferred)

| Evidence Type | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Code analysis | Detailed breakdown of malicious behavior |
| Timeline correlation | Package updated during attack window |
| Multiple sources | Confirmed by 2+ security researchers |
| Behavioral analysis | Observed malicious network activity |

### Evidence Templates

#### For Malicious File Discovery

```markdown
## Evidence: Malicious File

**Package:** @scope/package-name
**Version:** 1.2.3

### File Found
- Location: `node_modules/@scope/package-name/setup_bun.js`
- SHA-1: d1829b4708126dcc7bea7437c04d1f10eacd4a16

### Verification
```bash
shasum -a 1 node_modules/@scope/package-name/setup_bun.js
# Output: d1829b4708126dcc7bea7437c04d1f10eacd4a16
```

### Screenshot
[Attach screenshot of file contents]
```

#### For Postinstall Script Analysis

```markdown
## Evidence: Malicious Postinstall

**Package:** package-name
**Version:** 2.0.0

### package.json scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node setup_bun.js"
  }
}
```

### Script Behavior
1. Downloads Bun runtime from [URL]
2. Executes bun_environment.js
3. Scans for credentials
4. Uploads to GitHub

### Network Activity
[Paste network logs or screenshots]
```

## Verification Process

All submissions go through a verification process:

### Automated Checks

1. **Schema Validation** - JSON structure is valid
2. **Duplicate Check** - Package not already in database
3. **Name Validation** - Valid npm package name format
4. **Version Format** - Valid semver range

### Manual Review

1. **Evidence Review** - Maintainer verifies evidence
2. **Cross-Reference** - Check against known sources
3. **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate severity level
4. **Merge Decision** - Approve, request changes, or reject

### Review Timeline

| Priority | Response Time | Merge Time |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Critical (active attack) | < 2 hours | < 4 hours |
| High (confirmed) | < 24 hours | < 48 hours |
| Medium (suspected) | < 48 hours | < 1 week |
| Low (needs investigation) | < 1 week | Varies |

## FAQ

### Q: How quickly are submissions reviewed?

Critical submissions (active threats) are prioritized and typically reviewed within 2-4 hours. Regular submissions are reviewed within 24-48 hours.

### Q: What if I'm not sure about the severity?

When in doubt, use `medium` severity. Maintainers will adjust based on evidence during review.

### Q: Can I submit packages found by automated tools?

Yes, but please verify the findings manually before submission. Include the tool name and output in your evidence.

### Q: What happens if my submission is rejected?

You'll receive feedback explaining why. You can provide additional evidence and resubmit.

### Q: How do I know if a package was already reported?

1. Search the `compromised-packages.json` file
2. Search existing GitHub issues
3. Use our search tool:
   ```bash
   grep -i "package-name" compromised-packages.json
   ```

### Q: Can I submit packages from private registries?

Yes, if they're related to the Shai-Hulud attack. Mark them clearly as private registry packages.

### Q: What about scoped packages?

Include the full scope: `@scope/package-name`, not just `package-name`.

### Q: How are versions handled?

- `["*"]` - All versions affected
- `[">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"]` - Specific range affected
- Add `patchedVersion` when a fix is available
