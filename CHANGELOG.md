## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-02

### Why This Release?

After the initial Shai-Hulud 2.0 attack on November 24, 2025, security researchers from Wiz, Datadog Security Labs, and others continued investigating the aftermath. Their findings revealed additional attack vectors and persistence mechanisms that v1.x could not detect:

1. **Backdoor Persistence**: The attack planted `on: discussion` workflow triggers that persist even after removing compromised packages
2. **Rogue Runner Installation**: Attackers installed self-hosted runners in `$HOME/.dev-env/` for long-term access
3. **Malware Variants**: Multiple variants of `bun_environment.js` exist with different SHA256 hashes

This release incorporates these findings to provide comprehensive detection coverage.

### Added

#### SHA256 Hash Matching (Critical)
- **What**: Cryptographic signature matching against known Shai-Hulud malware variants
- **Why**: Security researchers at Datadog identified 6+ unique variants of the malicious `bun_environment.js` payload. Simple filename matching is insufficient - attackers can rename files. SHA256 hash matching provides definitive malware identification.
- **How**: Files named `setup_bun.js` or `bun_environment.js` are hashed and compared against the IOC database from Datadog Security Labs

#### on:discussion Workflow Trigger Detection (Critical)
- **What**: Detects GitHub Actions workflows with `on: discussion` triggers
- **Why**: Wiz's aftermath analysis revealed that the attack creates workflows triggered by GitHub discussions. These triggers allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands by simply posting a discussion comment - a persistent backdoor that survives package cleanup.
- **How**: Scans all `.yml`/`.yaml` files in `.github/workflows/` for the `on: discussion` pattern

#### Runner Installation Path Detection (Critical)
- **What**: Detects `.dev-env/` directories and specific GitHub Actions runner artifacts
- **Why**: The attack installs rogue self-hosted runners to maintain persistent access. These are installed in `$HOME/.dev-env/` and use `actions-runner-linux-x64-2.330.0.tar.gz`. Detection of these artifacts indicates active compromise.
- **How**: Scans the repository and home directory for `.dev-env/` directories and runner installation files
- **Source**: [Wiz - Shai-Hulud 2.0 Investigation](https://www.wiz.io/blog/shai-hulud-2-0-ongoing-supply-chain-attack)

#### New Exfiltration File Detection
- **What**: Added detection for `actionsSecrets.json` and `trufflehog_output.json`
- **Why**: These files contain stolen credentials. `actionsSecrets.json` stores GitHub Actions secrets with double Base64 encoding before exfiltration. `trufflehog_output.json` contains raw TruffleHog credential scan results.
- **How**: File existence checks during directory scanning

#### Enhanced IOC Database (v2.0.0)
- **What**: Expanded Indicators of Compromise database
- **Why**: Provides comprehensive threat intelligence from multiple security research sources
- **New fields**:
  - `fileHashes.*.sha256` - SHA256 hashes (single or array for variants)
  - `gitHubIndicators.repoNamePattern` - Regex for malicious repo names (`[0-9a-z]{18}`)
  - `gitHubIndicators.workflowTrigger` - Malicious trigger pattern
  - `runnerPaths` - Runner installation locations
  - `credentialPaths` - Targeted credential files
  - `primaryInfectionVectors` - Known initial infection packages
  - `mavenPackages` - Java/Maven ecosystem packages affected
  - `acknowledgements` - Security researcher credits

#### New Security Finding Types
- `malware-hash-match` - File hash matches known malware
- `runner-installation` - Rogue runner artifacts detected
- `malicious-workflow-trigger` - Dangerous workflow trigger found

### Changed

- **Database version**: Updated from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
- **FileHash structure**: Now supports both SHA-1 and SHA-256, with support for multiple variants per file
- **SARIF tool version**: Updated to 2.0.0
- **README action version**: Updated examples to use `@v2`

### Preserved from v1.x

All features from v1.x releases continue to work:

- **Semver Version Matching** (PR #11) - Precise version range detection reduces false positives
- **Scan node_modules Option** (PR #9) - Optional deep scanning of installed packages
- **iOS Xcode False Positive Fix** (PR #5) - Correctly excludes `.xcassets/*/contents.json`
- **CLI Flags & Environment Variables** (PR #4) - Flexible configuration options
- **Total Dependencies Count** (PR #10) - Accurate dependency counting
